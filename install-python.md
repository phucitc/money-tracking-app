If you are using Python 3.8.0 on Ubuntu 18.04 and want to update to a more recent version of Python 3.8, you can consider using the pyenv tool. pyenv allows you to easily manage and install different versions of Python on your system.

Here's how you can use pyenv to install a more recent version of Python 3.8:

Install Prerequisites:

Install the necessary prerequisites for building Python from source:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl git
Install pyenv:

You can install pyenv using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
curl -L https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/raw/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
After installation, add pyenv to your shell profile by running:

bash
Copy code
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Install Python 3.8.12:

Now you can use pyenv to install a specific version of Python. Here, we'll install Python 3.8.12 as an example:

bash
Copy code
pyenv install 3.8.12
Set the Global Python Version:

Set the newly installed version of Python as the global default:

bash
Copy code
pyenv global 3.8.12
Check Python Version:

Verify that the Python version has been updated:

bash
Copy code
python --version
Remember to restart your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc after making changes to your shell profile.
