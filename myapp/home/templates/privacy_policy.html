                <p>
                    Information Security and Data Privacy Policy of ZIPIT.LINK</p>

                <h3>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT IS ZIPIT.LINK</h3>
                <p>ZIPIT.LINK is the manufacturer and owner of ZIPIT.LINK (referred to collectively as "Software" or
                    "Service" by us). ZIPIT.LINK is a software for creating and managing online links, supporting
                    various features related to links, affiliate links, shorten links etc.</p>

                <p>ZIPIT.LINK respects and commits to protecting your privacy.
                    This privacy policy applies to all ZIPIT.LINK products and services provided. Please read this
                    privacy policy carefully to understand the commitments we make to respect and protect your rights.

                </p>

                <h3>LOGIN SECURITY</h3>
                <p>
                    Directly log into ZIPIT.LINK with your email and password. ZIPIT.LINK requires a minimum of 8
                    characters for passwords. Unsuccessful login attempts will trigger a 30-second lockout period before
                    users can retry. Passwords are stored as hashes and will never be sent via emailâ€”when creating an
                    account and resetting a password, ZIPIT.LINK will send a link to the email associated with the
                    account to allow users to create a new password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The complexity of passwords and session length requirements cannot be customized in the application.
                    However, they can be set in the IdP for the SSO execution group.
                </p>
